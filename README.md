EnvatoAPI2DB
============

Just a quick hack to get Envato theme data into a mysql database. I use it to populate additional theme options for customers looking to buy off the shelf website packages.  Very dirty and procedural but I do plan on making this a nice tidy package after the project launches. Uses a bunch of outdated or insecure code, not for use in production.

Use:

1) Use the .sql to build your table.

2) Upload insert.php to your host.

3) Enter theme ID into the form.

4) Upload viewer.php.

5) Boom, Roasted.

## Here is a screenshot of it running on my site. Framework is Bootstrap 3.0. This is with an updated version of viewer.php. I have not added it to this repo to be platform and implimentation agnostic.
