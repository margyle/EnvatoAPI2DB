EnvatoAPI2DB
============

Just a quick hack to get Envato theme data onto my site for use in packages and theme installs. Very dirty and procedural but I do plan on making this a nice tidy package after the project launches. Uses a bunch of outdated or insecure code, not for use in production.

Use:
1) Use the .sql to build your table
2) Upload install.php to your host
3) Enter theme ID into the form.
4) Boom, roasted.
